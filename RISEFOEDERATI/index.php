			<p align="justify">Rise of the Foederati is an online, massive multiplayer strategy game that combines real-time strategy with turn-based combat. You play as a leader of one of the many tribes surrounding the Roman borders in mid-5th century AD, and your objective is to lead your warriors into raids, skirmishes and battles to survive. More important than winning battles, however, is to wade through the intricacies of managing your warband, as your soldiers will support your leadership as long as you bring them loot and glory. A weak leader, however, may face discontent warriors that will desert, abandon formations, disrespect your commands, or even challenge you to take control of your group!
