			<h3>
Late Ancient history like you've never seen before in a game</h3>
		<h4>Rise of the Foederati is an online, massive multiplayer strategy game that combines real-time strategy with turn-based combat. You play as a leader of one of the many tribes surrounding the Roman borders in mid-5th century AD, and your objective is to lead your warriors into raids, skirmishes and battles to survive.
		More important than winning battles, however, is to wade through the intricacies of managing your warband, as your soldiers will support your leadership as long as you bring them loot and glory. A weak leader, however, may face discontent warriors that will desert, abandon
		formations, disrespect your commands, or even challenge you to take control of your group! 
		 </h4>
	
			<h3>Spine-chilling, realistic immersion</h3> 
			<h4>
				
 
What you hear is what it is. A knife stab. A shield blocking an incoming sword. The jingling sound of coins inside a bag. Nearly every sound you hear in Rise was recorded in studios to be as realistic as possible. The eerie feeling before a battle now feels more tense than ever, with dynamic music that shifts with a battle's progress.  
			</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Soundtracks mastered through influence in old classics and recent award-winner games. The entirety of Rise's OST was created to set the tune for the ambience.

				</li>
				<li>
					Sound effects were recorded with the best portrayal of the setting. Details such as the metalforging in the period were used to determine the exact tune of a sword, spear or axe cutting through soft flesh, or striking something harder like wood or metal. 

				</li>
				<li>
					The roaring voice of a commander in the battlefield brings to you their own raw feelings as you fight;. a desperate yell for soldiers to hold their ground; the faint confidence in a successful flank attack; the frantic call of survival for a retreat. All in their original, extinct languages.

				</li>
						</ul>
				<h3>
						Deep, intricate, and tactical gameplay
 
				</h3>
				<h4>
				
Witness your soldiers improve as they wage wars with you. 
				</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Death is permanent. Not even you are exempt from this rule. If your unit dies, a successor is appointed, and you continue the game as him.
</li>
					<li>
						Terrain can be a troublesome trap to your units. Crossing rough terrain may be harder than paved roads, resulting in units taking longer than expected to cross the wilderness. Horses are especially affected by this. 

					</li>
					<li>
						Soldiers not only naturally evolve and adapt, but also can be trained in specific abilities. Rise's ability system may make two similar units become trained for different tasks. Make your cavalry more mobile, more offensively oriented towards flanking, or even sturdier in frontal attacks. Train your archers in long-range shooting, or in skirmish tactics to avoid getting engaged upom.

					</li>
					<li>
						The consequences of your victories and your defeats linger on. Even if you win a battle, soldiers get wounded or tired and may need to recover. The loot of a successful raid still must be hauled to a nearby village or city to be sold. Will you use logistics and ox carts to carry it? Or will your soldiers carry it on their backs? A soldier who feels like you did not reward him enough for his efforts may remember such a slight when talks of mutiny come around.

					</li>
					<li>
						Rivalry between your soldiers may spill over into the battlefield. Bring with you two feuding soldiers, and they may feel disrespected by your command. Solve this by making them settle your differences in camp, either with a fistfight or a duel. Be warned, though; blood and even death might come from a duel if such rivalry runs deep in their skin.

					</li>
					<li>
						Weather mechanics make battlefields an ever-changing place. Battles in heavy rain, windy plains or snowy mountains affect the way your tactics should be applied. 

					</li>
					<li>
						Manage your camp, rations and equipment. Pay your soldiers and mercenaries and divide the spoils of war. Supervise the training of your own soldiers. Rent them to other players as a way to honor a trade, or even supply your soldiers to local city militias to passively control the city with your own forces!

					</li>
				<li>
					Sell your captured enemies as slaves, negotiate their release with the enemy, or release those who fought honorably to pay your respect. Or, if they killed one of your own men in battle, 'eye for an eye' philosophy has rarely been more in vogue.

				</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>
					Politics paved with power and casualties

				</h3>
	<h4>
	An ever-changing political scene awaits you. Within each swing of the pendulum of power, you'll be forced to make decisions that may have long-term repercussions. For example, if a huge force from a previously neutral tribe attacks your own, it may require your warband to ally itself with old enemies against this new threat.	
	</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Though each tribe has a king, warlord, or chieftain that is the de facto ruler, there are numerous other leaders that hold enough power to challenge their position. If the political state starts to lose its balance and a civil war occurs, will you stand with your ruler or support the rebels?

		</li>
		<li>
			The Western Roman Empire, though decadent, is still the major holder of power in the world. Will you challenge their position or support their own candidates to rule a tribe? For the Empire, tribes waging war on each other is much more beneficial than a common alliance.

		</li>
		<li>
			Support your tribe's allies or sabotage their own alliances by raiding an ally's village. Just don't get caught!

		</li>
		<li>
			Work as a mercenary for Rome to push their influence over the world. Will you backstab your own tribe to become the next greatest Roman Foederati general?

		</li>
		<li>
			Gain influence in local cities to earn the trust of it's ruler. Nothing is safer than city walls to protect your hard-earned spoils. 

		</li>
	</ul>
		<h3>Historical accuracy
</h3>
		<h4>
			The Dark Ages (or, more accurately, Migration Period) as you have never seen before. Rise of the Foederati has historical accuracy down to the most minimal detail. From the pronounciation of one of the dozen extinct languages of the period to the design of warriors' armaments, the experience you have is as historically accurate as it gets. 

		</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Proto-Norse, Gothic, Latin, West Frisian (and more). Languages once extinct, now ressurected to bring the speech of your warbands to life. 

			</li>
			<li>
				Explore the decadent cities of the once-glorious Roman Empire. Drawing extensively from research on archeological findings, the artists portraying the Empire made all efforts towards presenting period-accurate city life.

			</li>
			<li>
				Unit names portray accurately their position or function in a warband. A "Visigoth Spearman" is a "Visigoth Haramanne" (this is an optional feature).

			</li>
			<li>
				The local flora and fauna is what it is. Animals near extinction or completely extinct, such as the Iberian Lynx and the Aurochsen can once again be seen in the region of the Pyrenées. Local trees, like the Pyrenean Oak, unique to their own region, are also portrayed. 

			</li>
			
		</ul>
		<h3>Morale and Fatigue - The soldier's mind and body
</h3>
		<h4>
			A soldier will fight with you, but he is not an unwavering machine of destruction. He will doubt his actions and your orders, and exert himself as much as he can to stay alive in the gruesome terrors of war. For example:

		</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Your soldiers spot your cavalry getting slaughtered in a failed charge. Without horseback warriors to flank the enemy, your soldiers start to question if victory is still at hand.

			</li>
			<li>
				One of your soldiers over-exerted himself hard to live through combat. He starts to breathe heavily, his shield weighs on him ever more. If you don't cover him until he can recover, he is an easy target for anyone with a mind for blood.

			</li>
			<li>
				Your archers are out of ammunition, and the enemy takes the opportunity to charge at them. Without the cover of other warriors, they may not fend off the attack easily.

			</li>
			<li>
				Two of your warriors are brothers. One of them just witnessed his brother fall in battle. The sight of the potential loss of his brother makes the other rage and break formation in his thirst for vengeance.

			</li>
			<li>
				One of the enemy's flanks in a melee has broken. Your soldiers in the opposite flank rejoice, as the hopes of winning the battle blossom. 

			</li>
			<li>
				A stray arrow from the enemy lodges in you. The wound is dire, but you are still able to fight. However, the soldiers beside you will question if you are still okay; losing a leader affects the entire group's morale.

			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>As long as your soldiers perceive that the battle is going well, their morale will rise; their efficiency in general will increase, and their thoughts to live another day become stronger. On the other hand, the more a warrior fights the more tired he becomes, raising his fatigue and exhausting him. Fighting efficiently is as important as fighting well. 
</h4>
		<h3> Rally your friends, raid your enemies, protect your tribe
</h3>
		<h4>Hundreds of players are present at the same time in Rise. Your movements and battles are present in real-time; there are no instances in the world. Your actions make a mark in the world. The more people you bring to your side, the bigger your actions are. 
</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Share your command with a friend! Rise allows up to three players to command one single warband at the same time. Merge forces for even bigger clashes against enemies. Or even leave your own friend to manage a few of your soldiers for a time!

			</li>
			<li>
				Play as the enemy anytime! If you want a more challenging play, you can join in to play as the enemy of a player. If he's raiding a village which has a militia, you can play as the militia's captain. Though it's a hard fight, if you think your army isn't strong enough to take raids, or is recovering from a hard battle, you can at anytime join in at a random battle happening in the world to help your tribe, or even another different tribe across the world. Pick the one you want to defend as, and help your tribe defend itself by proxy!

			</li>
			<li>
				Build your clan fame with your friends! A highly-regarded clan can have additional benefits from the tribal king/warlord, gaining more elite troops periodically, or even be the possibility of a single-clan siege in an enemy city. Clans receive missions that are greater in responsability (and reward).
